Overview
Chapter 1: Primitive and Reference Types introduces the two different
value types in JavaScript: primitive and reference. You’ll learn what distinguishes
them from each other and how understanding their differences
is important to an overall understanding of JavaScript.
Chapter 2: Functions explains the ins and outs of functions in
JavaScript. First-class functions are what makes JavaScript such an interesting
language.
Chapter 3: Understanding Objects details the makeup of objects in
JavaScript. JavaScript objects behave differently than objects in other languages,
so a deep understanding of how objects work is vital to mastering
the language.
Chapter 4: Constructors and Prototypes expands on the previous
discussion of functions by looking more specifically at constructors. All
constructors are functions, but they are used a little bit differently. This
chapter explores the differences while also talking about creating your
own custom types.
Chapter 5: Inheritance explains how inheritance is accomplished
in JavaScript. Though there are no classes in JavaScript, that doesn’t
mean inheritance isn’t possible. In this chapter, you’ll learn about prototypal
inheritance and how it differs from class-based inheritance.
Chapter 6: Object Patterns walks through common object patterns.
There are many different ways to build and compose objects in
JavaScript, and this chapter introduces you to the most popular patterns
for doing so.
